    "Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all instances predicted as positive. It focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions. Mathematically, precision is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. It focuses on the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances. Mathematically, recall is calculated as TP / (TP + FN), where FN is the number of false negatives.\n",

    "Q2. What is the F1 score and how is it calculated? How is it different from precision and recall?\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall. The F1 score is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates better model performance. The F1 score is useful when there is an uneven class distribution or when false positives and false negatives have different costs.\n"

    "ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic): The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR or recall) and the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. It helps visualize the performance of a binary classification model across different threshold values.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve): AUC quantifies the overall performance of a binary classification model by calculating the area under the ROC curve. AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates better model performance. AUC is often used as a single metric to compare different models or evaluate the performance of a model across various threshold settings.\n",
